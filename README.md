Contributing to the REST cookbook
---------------------------------
The REST cookbook website uses [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki), a simple yet powerfull blog engine 
that easily allows for creating simple websites like these.

Contributing to our site is simple:
  * Fork the website to your own github account.
  * Clone your repository onto your computer. Make sure you create a new branch, and not use the master branch.
  * Create a new page inside the /recipies/* directory. For instance, if you create a new recipie under the HTTP verbs chapter, create it under /recipies/httpverbs.
  * If you want to create a new chapter, that's fine too, just make sure it makes sense (otherwise, put it under miscellaneous)
  * Update the sidebar, which can be found under _layouts/default.html
  * Add & commit your changes, and push it to your repository.
  * Create a pull request and we will try and merge your recipe.
