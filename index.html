<h2 id='welcome_to_the_rest_cookbook'>Welcome to the REST CookBook</h2>

<p>REST is an amazingly powerful and flexible tool. It&#8217;s one that can change your daily work flow for the better once you start using it, but like all open ended tools, it can take a little while to become familiar with.</p>

<p>Over the years of using puppet I&#8217;ve noticed that people often come up with the same kind of requests, &#8220;How do I restart this service when the config file changes?&#8221;, &#8220;How can I include a package in multiple places?&#8221;, and while puppet can easily fulfil these needs sometimes the documentation is more focused on
l itself rather than what can be achieved with it. Throughout this site I&#8217;ll attempt to answer task driven questions and provide somewhere that I can point people to in the future.</p>
